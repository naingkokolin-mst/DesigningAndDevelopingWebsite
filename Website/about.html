        <h1>Mercedes-Benz</h1>
        <p>Mercedes-Benz commonly referred to as Mercedes and
            sometimes as Benz, is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926.
            Mercedes-Benz AG (a
            Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in 2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg,
            Germany.[1]
            Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and light commercial vehicles badged as Mercedes-Benz.
            From November
            2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler
            Truck, a former
            part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent company in late 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was
            the largest
            brand of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.[8]

            The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz
            Patent-Motorwagen,
            which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. The slogan
            for the
            brand is "the best or nothing".
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz
            Patent
            Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] – and Gottlieb Daimler and
            their
            engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced
            later that year.
            The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).

            Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, a Jewish-Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, registered the
            trademark in 1902,
            naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and
            marketing strategist
            who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society. At the time, it was a
            meeting place
            for the haute volée of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family
            and other
            wealthy clients, but as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, including to
            billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek drove
            under the
            pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès". Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a brand. In 1901, the
            name
            "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz branded
            vehicles were
            produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz
            company on 28
            June of the same year.

            Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in
            France, he
            attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical
            activities in France
            and England, he started working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was appointed
            workshop
            inspector at a machine-tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.

            In 1958, the two companies began a partnership to sell their cars in the United States with Studebaker. A few
            American-based Daimler Benz dealerships were converted into Mercedes-Benz dealerships when Daimler's
            non-Mercedes-partnered company closed in 1966.

            Over the decades, Mercedes-Benz has introduced many electronic and mechanical innovations and safety features that
            later
            became common.[18] Currently, Mercedes-Benz is one of the best-known and longest-standing automotive brands in the
            world. The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz.

            In November 2019, Daimler AG announced that Mercedes-Benz, until that point a company marque, would be spun off into
            a
            separate, wholly owned subsidiary called Mercedes-Benz AG. The new subsidiary would manage the Mercedes-Benz car and
            van
            business. Mercedes-Benz-badged trucks and buses would be part of the Daimler Truck AG subsidiary.[1]
        
            For information relating to the three-pointed star symbol of the brand, see under the title
            Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, including the merger into Daimler-Benz.

            In May 2022, Mercedes-Benz announced that it has recently sold the most expensive car at the price of $142 million
            (€135
            million).[20] The car is a very rare 1955 Mercedes-Benz SLR that has been kept in the German automaker's collection
            and
            bought by a private owner. Mercedes in an announcement said that the sale will be used to establish the
            Mercedes-Benz
            Fund.[21]
        
            In June 2022, Mercedes-Benz recalled almost one million vehicles built between 2004 and 2015, due to potential
            problems
            with their braking system, caused by possible "advanced corrosion".
